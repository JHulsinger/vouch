## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred: use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (the “Report a vulnerability” button) which creates a private draft security advisory for maintainers.

If that option is unavailable for any reason, email the details to `jhulsinger@gmail.com`.

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will work to address them privately before disclosing them publicly.
