## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (the “Report a vulnerability” button) which creates a private draft security advisory for maintainers.

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will work to address them privately before disclosing them publicly.
