**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when `vouch` doesn't export the private key in PKCS#8 format.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A description of what you want to happen. For example, adding a `--pkcs8` argument or intercepting the finalization payload.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Could this feature be implemented externally inside an `IpcPlugin` instead of the Rust core?

**Additional context**
